# AWS II
*This topic is split in three parts.*

## AWS services
- **Amazon RDS** \
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

- **Amazon DynamoDB** \
 Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools.

## AWS exercises
We will cover some basic networking concepts, how to create an RDS database, connect two VPCs and use a NoSQL database. We will continue playing the learning game developed by AWS: [AWS Cloud Quest](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/11458/play/42651/play-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner)
