# AWS III
*This topic is split in three parts.*

## AWS services
- **AWS IAM** \
With AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS, centrally manage fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.
- **Amazon EFS** \
 Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files with no need for management or provisioning. 

## AWS exercises
We will cover everyting until the end of the learning game developed by AWS: [AWS Cloud Quest](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/11458/play/42651/play-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner)
